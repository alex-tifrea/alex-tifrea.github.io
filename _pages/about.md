I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Computer Science of ETH Zürich. 
I am conducting my research under the supervision of [Fanny Yang](http://fanny-yang.de) in the [Statistical Machine Learning](https://sml.inf.ethz.ch) group.

Prior to starting my PhD, I have completed an MSc in Computer Science at ETH Zürich and
a BSc in Computer Engineering at Politehnica University Bucharest.
For my Master's degree, I was the recipient of a scholarship awarded by ETH Zürich.

During my studies I have interned at Mozilla (*San Francisco, CA*), Facebook (*Seattle, WA & London, UK*), BitDefender (*Bucharest, RO*), Microsoft (*London, UK*) and Google (*Zürich, CH*).
More recently, I spent 4 months at Google Brain Zürich where I collaborated with Hartmut Maennel on out-of-distribution detection.

My current interests revolve around various theoretical and methodological aspects of
robustness to distribution shifts, uncertainty estimation and representation learning.
