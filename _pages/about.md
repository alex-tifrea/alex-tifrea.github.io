I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Computer Science of ETH Zürich. 
I am conducting my research under the supervision of [Fanny Yang](http://fanny-yang.de) in the [Statistical Machine Learning](https://sml.inf.ethz.ch) group.

Prior to starting my PhD, I have completed an MSc in Computer Science at ETH Zürich and
a BSc in Computer Engineering at Politehnica University Bucharest.
For my Master's degree, I was the recipient of a scholarship awarded by ETH Zürich.

My current interests revolve around various theoretical and methodological aspects of
trustworthy ML (distribution shifts, fairness, uncertainty estimation) and representation learning.
