I am a Research Scientist at Google DeepMind currently working on developing
better algorithms for large language model post-training. Prior to that,
I obtained my PhD from the Department of Computer Science of ETH Zürich,
working under the supervision of [Fanny Yang](http://fanny-yang.de) in the
[Statistical Machine Learning](https://sml.inf.ethz.ch) group. Before that
I completed a MSc degree in Computer Science at ETH Zürich and a BSc degree in
Computer Engineering at Politehnica University Bucharest.

I'm broadly interested in various theoretical and methodological aspects of
trustworthy ML (distribution shifts, fairness, uncertainty estimation),
data-efficient learning (active learning, semi-supervised learning) and
representation learning.
